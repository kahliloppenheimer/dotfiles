# This script eases the process of moving to new workstations. All you have to
# do is put all of your "dotfiles" (i.e. .vimrc, .zshrc, etc.) into a folder
# whose name you specify ($dir) without a '.' before each of their names. Then
# run the script.
#
# If you store this script and your dotfiles directory in a git repo, then all
# you need to do when moving to a new workstation is
#
# git clone https://github.com/YourName/YourRepo.git
# YourRepo/setup_workstation
#
# Here is what the script actually does:
#
# 1) Move all existing dotfiles from ~/ into $olddir
# 2) Symlink all of the dotfiles from $dir into your home directory
# 3) Install homebrew (if necessary)
# 4) Install git (if necessary)
# 5) Install Vundle (vim plugin manager) if necessary
# 6) Install vim plugins specified in your vimrc using Vundle
# 7) Install zsh (if necessary) and set it to be your default shell
